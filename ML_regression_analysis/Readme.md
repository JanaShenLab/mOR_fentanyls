snapshot_groups.zip contains the input files (mean interaction energies from each of 100 sampling trials). The notebook analysis_sample.ipynb walks through the analysis (regression, feature importance calculations, SHAP calculations). The MISC folder contains example input scripts and configuration files for interaction energy calculations.

Calculating unbiased interaction energy histograms follows the same procedure as the postporocessing analysis of metadynamics trajectories and was done using PLUMED.
